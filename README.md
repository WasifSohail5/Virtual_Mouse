## 🛠 **How It Works** 🔍

📷 **Step 1: Webcam Capture**  
OpenCV accesses your webcam, flips the video for a **mirror view**, and processes the frames in real time.

✋ **Step 2: Hand Landmark Detection**  
MediaPipe detects hand landmarks and extracts **critical points** such as fingertips and knuckles.

📐 **Step 3: Gesture Recognition**  
Using **distance calculations** between fingertips, Virtual Mouse interprets gestures like clicks and scrolls.

🖥️ **Step 4: Mouse Control**  
PyAutoGUI maps detected hand movements to your screen, ensuring a seamless experience.
