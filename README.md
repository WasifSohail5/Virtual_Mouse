üñ±Ô∏è Virtual Mouse ‚Äì Hands-Free Computer Control üñêÔ∏è
Take control of your computer without touching a single device! Virtual Mouse uses your webcam to track hand gestures in real time, translating them into smooth mouse movements and clicks. Experience a futuristic, contactless interaction with your PC!

‚ú® Key Features
Real-Time Hand Tracking:
Utilizes MediaPipe to detect and track your hand movements with precision.

Gesture-Based Controls:

Left Click: Triggered when your index finger and thumb come close together.
Double Click: Quickly perform two left-clicks with a specific gesture timing.
Right Click: Activated using the middle finger in combination with the thumb.
Scroll Mode: Detects when your fingers align to initiate smooth scrolling.
Smooth Cursor Movement:
Implements a smoothing algorithm to ensure your cursor moves fluidly, mirroring natural hand movements.

Customizable Thresholds:
Fine-tune click and scroll sensitivity with adjustable parameters like click threshold and scroll factors.

üöÄ Installation Guide
‚úÖ Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Pip for package management
üõ† Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/virtual-mouse.git
cd virtual-mouse
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you don't have a requirements.txt, make sure to install:

OpenCV (opencv-python)
MediaPipe (mediapipe)
PyAutoGUI (pyautogui)
NumPy (numpy)
Run the Application:

bash
Copy
Edit
python Virtual\ Mouse.py
üí° How It Works
Webcam Capture:
OpenCV grabs frames from your webcam and flips them for a mirror view.

Hand Landmark Detection:
MediaPipe identifies key landmarks on your hand. The code computes distances (using NumPy and math operations) between landmarks (e.g., between the index finger and thumb) to determine the intended gesture.

Gesture Interpretation:

Clicks: Based on proximity thresholds between fingers.
Scrolling: When the standard deviation of specific landmarks falls below a threshold, scrolling mode is activated.
Mouse Control:
PyAutoGUI maps the hand's position to your screen coordinates, moving the cursor and performing click actions.
